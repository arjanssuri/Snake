# Snake

This project is a Snake game using Python and the curses library. The game features a 20x60 game board, a snake that grows as it eats food, and increasingly fast gameplay as the snake grows longer. I implemented the game logic in a while loop that handles user input, updates the snake's position, and checks for game-over conditions. I also added a scoring system and randomly placed pieces of food on the board. The final score is displayed to the user when the game is over.
